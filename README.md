Practice and demo code - SQLRPGLE, SQL, DDS

This simple code was written for the purpose of skills refresh and demonstration.
It was not intended to be complete, robust, or to have a sensible architecture.
It was strictly a technical exercise.

Note: the JEG* files were complete RPG400 subfile processing production code.
